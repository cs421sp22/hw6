Hi Ali,

Here's a description of the signup system we'd like to have for Gateway Computing.

Over a semester-long Gateway Computing course, students typically take frequent in-class quizzes we call assessments. If a student doesn't perform above a  particular threshold score on a required in-class assessment, they may elect to sign up to take a single retake for that assessment.  The retake takes place outside of class during the following week.  We have a room reserved for a number of specific 50-minute sessions during the week, and two course assistants jointly proctor during each session. At any given time, we can only accommodate a fixed number of student retakes, to ensure effective proctoring. When we have 2 proctors for a session, the maximum number of student retakes allowed during that session is 10.  Depending on course enrollments, we could have anywhere from 2 to 10 different sessions planned for a given week.

We'd like an application that allows students to sign themselves up for retake sessions during a given week. The application should disallow a single student from signing up for more than one session during that week, and should not permit more than 10 students to sign up in any particular session.  For privacy reasons, students shouldn’t be able to access the list of students who have signed up for retake sessions, but they should be able to monitor the number of slots available in a given session. Once a student selects a time for their retake, they should receive an immediate email confirmation of their selected session. 

Course staff (instructors and course assistants) handle the setup within the system for an “event” (the list of all signup sessions planned for a given week). Any authorized member of the course staff should be able to log in to create an "event" (the list of all signup sessions planned for a given week), and later publish the event (create a signup link that can be shared with students) so that students can begin signing up. Before the publication of the event, course staff should be able to set up a custom window of time during which signups for that list will be permitted.  At any time during or after creating a week’s signup event, course staff should have the option to view a summary report which includes a list of the students signed up for each session. If possible, we’d also like to add a related component that allows course assistants to sign themselves up as proctors for the listed sessions, but students in the course shouldn’t be aware of this.

Until now, we have been using signupgenius.com for student retake signups, but to get some of the features we wanted, we need to pay for a premium account. We'd prefer to create an in-house signup system instead, and customize it to meet our needs exactly.

Please contact me if you have any questions.
